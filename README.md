# myupiflow - Privacy-First UPI Transaction Tracker

A comprehensive Flutter application for tracking UPI transactions with complete privacy and security. All data remains encrypted locally on your device with PIN and biometric protection.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This MVP implements a production-ready Flutter application with the following architecture:

### **Core Features**
- **Privacy-First Design**: No cloud sync, all data stays local
- **Advanced Security**: PIN + biometric authentication with auto-lock
- **Smart Transaction Parsing**: ML-powered SMS parsing (regex-based mock implementation)
- **Encrypted Local Storage**: All data encrypted using AES with secure key storage
- **Modern UI**: Material 3 design with custom financial app aesthetic
- **Comprehensive Export**: Encrypted JSON and CSV export functionality

### **Technical Stack**
- **Framework**: Flutter 3.x with null safety
- **State Management**: Riverpod for reactive state management
- **Database**: Drift (SQLite) with encryption support
- **Authentication**: local_auth + flutter_secure_storage
- **Routing**: GoRouter with authentication guards
- **Parsing**: Mock ML service with regex patterns for UPI transaction parsing

## 🚀 Quick Start

### **Prerequisites**
- Flutter SDK (stable)
- Android Studio / VS Code
- Android device/emulator or iOS simulator

### **Installation**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd upi_tracker_mvp

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Generate database code (if using Drift)
flutter packages pub run build_runner build

# Run the application
flutter run
```

### **Configuration**
1. **Mock Data**: Set `Config.useMockData = true` in `lib/src/core/constants.dart` for demo mode
2. **Development**: Debug tools available at `/debug` route when in development mode
3. **Production**: Ensure mock data is disabled for production builds

## 🔧 Development

### **Adding New Features**
1. Create feature module in `lib/src/features/`
